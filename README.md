# What is this repo is about?

-   This repo is geared toward first time contributors. There is no coding involved, only adding to a text file.
-   An editor of some type will be needed as well as an established GitHub account (it’s free and if you’re a coder, you need one.)
-   There are multiple methods to using GitHub and Git, we’re going to try and keep it as simple as possible.

# Who is it geared toward?

-   This repo is geared toward first time contributors, specifically our MilSpouse Coders family.

# Let's get started!

## Step 1: Create a GitHub account

-   We are going to provide tutorials for two methods of contributing to this repository: Command Line and GitHub Desktop. For either method you will need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/).
-   GitHub accounts are free! Yay! There is a paid version, but if you're just starting out, free is what matters.

## Step 2: Download Visual Studio Code

-   There are many code/text edititors and IDE's (integrated development environment) out there, but for this project and others we are recommending you download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
-   Why are we asking you to do this? Well, if you need help with something and you're using an editor we haven't used before, we're not going to be much help! That being said, if you're comfortable using another code editor, by all means, use it! We all have our favorites! Just remember, the Google search engine is your best friend for troubleshooting!
-   There is another platform called Visual Studio, which is an IDE for Windows machines only (sorry Mac users!), Visual Studio Code (VSC) is multi-platform. You can download it for your appropriate machine [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

## Step 3: Set up Git on your personal computer

-   Here is where things might start to get overwhelming, but we're letting you know that it's ok, we got you! (Cause' MilSpouses stick together! HOOAH!) If you have any questions at all, contact us or make a post on the MilSpouse Coders Study Group page!
-   The easiest way to set things up is through the command line interface. Don't let that scare you! We promise it will become your best friend! Check out [CodeCademy's](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/git-setup) instructions on how to set up Git on your personal machine.
-   Remember, if you have any questions/concerns/fears, ask the Study Group!

## Step 4: Contribute to this Repo

-   You made it to step 4! You're the bomb! Pat yourself on the back because Step 3 is a beast!
-   The next step in the process is to learn how to use Git and GitHub and contribute to open source code. So now, go check out the [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for guidelines on how to contribute to this repository.
