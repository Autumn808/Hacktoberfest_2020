# What is this repo is about?

-   This repo is geared toward first time contributors. There is no coding involved, only adding to a text file.
-   An editor of some type will be needed as well as an established GitHub account (it’s free and if you’re a coder, you need one.) Don't worry, we'll guide you through it in the steps below.
-   There are multiple methods to using GitHub and Git, we’re going to try and keep it as simple as possible.

# Who is it geared toward?
