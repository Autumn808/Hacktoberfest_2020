# Contributing to MilSpouseCoders Hacktoberfest_2020

MilSpouse Coders, weâ€™re going to break you into the magic of GitHub and contributing to a repo (repository)! This is a simple project with no coding invloved. The end goal is to have you add your GitHub user name and the location of your first-duty station to the file [first_duty_station.md](first_duty_station.md) in this repository.

### Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [info@milspousecoders.org](mailto:info@milspousecoders.org).

# Start here

There are multiple ways to contribute to a repo and it's up to you to chose what you're most comfortable with. Don't let anyone tell you that your way is the wrong way, contributing and working together is the end goal, so block those naysayers out!

### Command line method

If you're comfortable using the command line interface (CLI) on your personal machine, go to this tutorial:

-   [Command Line](command-line-tutorial.md)

### GitHub Desktop method

If the command line is a bit intimidating right now and you'd be more comfortable using a GUI (graphical user interface), go to this tutorial:
