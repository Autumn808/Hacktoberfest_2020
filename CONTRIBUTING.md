# CONTRIBUTING.MD

Alright MilSpouse Coders, we’re going to break you into the magic of GitHub and contributing to a repo!

## Step 1: Fork the repository

-   This first thing you want to do is fork this repository. This will create a copy of this repository in your personal GitHub account.

## Step 2: Clone the repository

-   The second step is to get the repository onto your personal machine, this is called cloning.
-   Go to your personal GitHub account and click the green button that says, “Clone or Download”.
-   (Which method do we suggest? Terminal or using GitHub desktop? Or do we make sure they know how to do both?)

## Step 3: Create a branch

-   The third step of this process is to create your own branch. When collaborating we don’t work directly on the Master branch, we keep our work separate and then submit it with the hope that it will eventually be merged into the Master branch.

## Step 4: Make a change to the AddYourNameHere.MD file

-   Now that you have your own branch it’s time to add your name to the appropriate file. Make sure you have the project opened your code editor and open up the file named AddYourNameHere.MD. There is no coding here, you’re just typing your GitHub name. After you’ve added your name, save the file.

## Step 5: Push changes to GitHub

-   You created a new branch and added to a file, so now it’s time to add those changes to your personal GitHub forked copy. You will be pushing those changes to your GitHub account.
-   Add a useful comment or description of the changes you made.
-   Push via the method that you’re using.

## Step 6: Create pull request & submit it

-   The final step is to say to the maintainers of the MSC Hacktoberfest_2020 repo, “Hey, I made an addition to your repo, please take a look at it! And, if it’s good enough, merge it into the master branch!”
-   Go to the repository on your personal GitHub and click the “Compare & Pull Request” button.
-   The comment/description that you added in the Push process should be shown. You are able to add additional comments at this point.
-   Click the “Create Pull Request” button and you’re done! The maintainers of the repo will take a look at it and if you did It right, your changes will be merged into the master branch of the repo.
