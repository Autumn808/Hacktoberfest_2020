# Making your first contribution using Github Desktop

## 1. Complete steps 1-3 in README.MD

Be sure you have completed steps 1 - 3 in the [README.MD](README.md) file.

## 2. Fork this repository

Fork this repository by clicking on the **fork** button on the top right of the main page of the repository [here](https://github.com/MilSpouseCoders/Hacktoberfest_2020).
This will create a copy of this repository in your personal GitHub account.

## 3. Clone the repository to your machine

Go to your _personal_ GitHub account and click on the forked copy of the repository that should now be listed. Click on the green **Code** button.

To clone the repo, click on "Code" and then click on "Open with GitHub Desktop".
<img style="left;" src="assets/step4_desktopclone.png" alt="clone this repository" width="300"/>

At this point, if you do not have GitHub Desktop installed, install it. If it is already installed, a pop up window will ask you if you want to use GitHub Desktop to open the link, select "open" or "open link".

The contents will be downloaded to your computer.

Now you have copied the contents of the hacktoberfest_2020 repository in GitHub to your personal computer.

## 4. Create a branch

Now create a branch by clicking on the "Current branch" icon at the top and then click on "New branch":
<img style="left;" src="assets/dt1-create-branch.png" alt="make a branch" />

Name your branch <add-your-github-handle>. For example, "add-james-smith"
<img style="left;" src="assets/dt1-create-branch-name.png" alt="name your branch" />

Click on `Create branch`

## 5. Make necessary changes and commit those changes

Now open `first_duty_station.md` file in a text editor, and follow the instructions on what to do.

Example: If your GitHub handle is jamessmith, It should look like this:

[//]: # "TODO: new image of what ours will look like"

<img style="left;" src="assets/dt1-status.png" alt="check status" />

You can see that there are changes to 'first_duty_station.md' and they have been added to the Github Desktop.

Now commit those changes:

-   Write the message "Add `<your-github-handle>` to first_duty_station.md" in the _summary_ field.

-   Replace `<your-github-handle>` with your GitHub handle.

-   Click on the button that says `Commit to add-your-github-handle`.

<img style="left;" src="assets/dt1-commit1.png" alt="commit your changes" />

At the bottom, you can see that the commit has been created.

Click the `Publish` button on the top right.

<img style="left;" src="assets/dt1-publish1.png" alt="push your changes" />

## 7. Submit your changes for review

Now go to your personal GitHub account, click _repositories_, and select the repository you're working with. You'll see a `Pull Request` tab at the top.

<img style="float: right;" src="assets/step7_pullrequest1.png" alt="create a pull request" width=600/>

Click on that tab and then click the green _Create Pull Request_ button.

<img style="float: right;" src="assets/step7_pullrequest.png" alt="create a pull request" width=600/>

Make sure it has a subject typed in and add any comments if necessary. Click _Create Pull Request_ one more time.

<img style="float: right;" src="assets/step7_pullrequest2.png" alt="submit pull request" width=600/>

That's it!
Soon we'll be merging all your changes into the master branch of this project. You will get a email notification once the changes have been merged.
