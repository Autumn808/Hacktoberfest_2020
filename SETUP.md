# Setup instructions

Here you will find instructions on what software and tools you will need to install on your personal machine in order to contribute to our repositories.

There are multiple ways to contribute to a repo and it's up to you to chose what you're most comfortable with. Don't let anyone tell you that your way is the wrong way, contributing and working together is the end goal, but for our projects here we are going to have a specific set of instructions for _beginners_ to follow. That way, if you have any questions about the process along the way, we can help you with that specific step more easily.

## Step 1: Create a GitHub account

GitHub is an online service that stores code pushed to it from computers that have the Git installed. Git is a version-control system for tracking changes in source code. It shows what changed, what it was previously, who changed it, when it was changed, and why it was changed (because when we _commit_ (a fancy word for save) the changes, we write messages to explain the change). Git is a programmers best friend!

-   If you don't have one, go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and create your free account.
-   There is a paid version, but if you're just starting out, free is all you need.

## Step 2: Download Visual Studio Code

-   There are many code/text edititors and IDE's (integrated development environment) out there, but for this project and others we are recommending you download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
-   Why are we asking you to do this? Well, if you need help with something and you're using an editor we haven't used before, we're not going to be much help. That being said, if you're comfortable using another code editor, by all means, use it.
-   There is another platform called Visual Studio, which is an IDE for Windows machines only (sorry Mac users), Visual Studio Code (VSC) is multi-platform. You can download it for your appropriate machine [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

## Step 3: Set up Git on your personal computer

-   Here is where things might start to get overwhelming, but we're letting you know that it's ok, we got you. (Cause' MilSpouses stick together, HOOAH!) If you have any questions at all, contact us or make a post on the MilSpouse Coders Study Group page.
-   The easiest way to set things up is through the command line interface. Don't let that scare you, we promise it will become your best friend. Check out [CodeCademy's](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/git-setup) instructions on how to set up Git on your personal machine.
-   Remember, if you have any questions/concerns/fears, ask the Study Group!

**At this point if you have Git setup and you'd prefer to use a different editor (other than Visual Studio Code), this is where you will leave this file.** - For instructions on how to contribute via the Command Line, please go [here](command-line-tutorial.md). - For instructions on how to contribute via GitHub Desktop, please go [here](github-desktop-tutorial.md).
